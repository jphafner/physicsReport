# introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a formal laboratory template that complies with professional style conventions.
It is recommended that this project be zip archived for upload to [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com).

```bash
$ zip -r physicsReport.zip revtex_example*
```

I should add a word of caution,
    I was criticized by my superiors because they viewed this as not being sufficiently scaffolded.
I would recommend having this approved by your superiors before utilizing this to help protect yourself.

# lesson-plan

This is my take on doing a formal laboratory report.
Take it with a grain of salt,
    as this reflects my values and experience.

The key feature of a formal laboratory is that it complies with professional standards and has been peer reviewed.
As long as the student submitted a draft copy for review,
    and were confident in checking off everything on the checklist,
    I gave them full credit.
If they submitted it for grading, without previously submitting for review and made changed accordingly,
    I would grade based on the rubric.

As for expectations for expressing uncertainty,
    I would expect all students to be able to express the average of measurement with a minimum and maximum value.
They could then use the average, minimum and maximum value for any calculated value.
For advanced students, I would expect then to be able to calculate the expectation and variance,
    and to propogate uncertainty accordingly in all calculated values.
I would provide any necessary formulas.
If _E[x]_ is the expectation of the variable _x_,
    then the variance can be calculated by _Var[x] = E[x<sup>2</sup>] - E[x]<sup>2</sup>_.

fake data for first year students,
    real data for advanced students or second year students.

## exploration (the E)

I only provide direct instruction to the point of having the zip file uploaded to [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com).
I would also recommend reviewing some keyboard shortcutes,
    Ctrl-Z for undo, Ctrl-Y for redo, Ctrl-X for cut, Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-V for paste.

Once the entire class has the zip file successfully loaded to [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com),
    I instruct them to make _small_ edits, and to recompile to see what happens.
I would give them at least 30 minutes to explore.
I think giving the students time to explore with no expectation is important.

## concept invention (the I)

This would be a good time for whiteboarding,
    make your own whiteboard to fill in the gaps of what you see.

## application (the A)

Where they write, and I proof read.
Checkout Benjamin Crowell's [_Light and Matter_](http://lightandmatter.com/lab_comment_codes.pdf) for ideas on comment codes.

# dependencies

These are only necessary if you desire to compile on your personal machine.
I will recommend [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) once again,
    as they have all necessary dependencies already.
