# introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a formal laboratory template that complies with professional style conventions.
It is recommended that this project be zip archived for upload to [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com).

```bash
$ zip -r physicsReport.zip revtex_example*
```

I should add a word of caution,
    I was criticized by my superiors because they viewed this as not being sufficiently scaffolded.
I would recommend having this approved by your superiors before utilizing this to help protect yourself.

# lesson-plan

## exploration

## concept invention

This would be a good time for whiteboarding,
    make your own whiteboard to fill in the gaps of what you see.

## application

Where they write, and I proof read.

# dependencies

These are only necessary if you desire to compile on your personal machine.
I will recommend [Share LaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) once again,
    as they have all necessary dependencies already.
